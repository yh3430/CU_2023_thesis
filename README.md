# CU_thesis for Yu He 2023 sping
## (A) main analysis piplines and ML method comparision were included files listed below:

#### 1.the ML_model_district.Rmd file include R code of ML algorithm training and analysis using random forest method for local school districts dataset

#### 2.the distric_pattern_analysis.Rmd include R code of applying the best_performed ML approach (lasso) to each local school district

#### 3.the ML_model_state.Rmd file include R code of ML algorithm training and analysis using random forest method for State dataset

#### 4.the state_pattern_analysis.Rmd include R code of applying the best_performed ML approach (ridge) to each State
  
## (B) the pop_chara_table.Rmd includes the code for table and figure generation.
## (C) the table folder contains the:

### 1.paper_table.xlsx file that includes all the tables use in the final paper

### 2.random_forest_each_state.xlsx includes the tables for entire random forest method results of each State

### 3.random_forest_each_district.xlsx includes the tables for entire random forest method results of each local school district

### 4.lass_regression_each_state.xlsx includes the table for entire lasso regression algorithm result of each State

### 5.ridge_regression_each_district.xlsx includes the table for entire ridge regression algorithm result of each local school district

## (D) the orignal dataset was not push to github due to their large size. But the dataset used in the analysis was uploaded and stored in the data folder.

## (E) the github also include paper's introduction, method, results, dicussion, and supplimentary material parts in different words files and the entire final paper in the paper folder. 

## (F) all the cited papers were stored in the citations_papers folder in pdf.
